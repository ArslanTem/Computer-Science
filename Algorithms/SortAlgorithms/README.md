Sort Algorithms
===============
Description
-----------
Main aim of the work is to determine the relation between Sort Algorithm Benchmark and Size of the Collection. Current repository contains the C# implementations for various `Sort Algorithms`, like, for example:

* Bubble Sort
* Cocktail Sort
* Counting Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Selection Sort

Benchmark of each implelemted algorithm is got and stored at `Benchmarks` folder of current repository. Tests are done for various sizes and types of arrays. 

**Conclusion**: The fastest Sort algorithm is `Quick Sort`. The fastest collection is `Array`.
